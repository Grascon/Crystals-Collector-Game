# Crystals Collector Game

This game was created using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, Javascript, jQuery. The rules of the game are as follows:

There will be four crystals displayed as buttons on the page.

The user will be shown a random number at the start of the game.

When the user clicks on a crystal, it will add a specific amount of points to the player's total score. 

The game will hide this amount until the user clicks a crystal.
When the user clicks one, the user's score counter is updated.

The user wins if their total score matches the random number from the beginning of the game.

The user loses if their score goes above the random number.

The game restarts whenever the user wins or loses.

When the game begins again, the user will see a new random number. Also, all the crystals will have four new hidden values. Of course, the user's score (and score counter) will reset to zero.

The app will show the number of games the user wins and loses.
